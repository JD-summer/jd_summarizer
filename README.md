# Job Description Summarizer
Job Description Summarization with NLP:


Problem:
In this pandemic era,many people are losing their jobs as they are not getting proper guidance on what they should know or what skills they should work on for a particular job profile. Also in addition to the same situation , many job seekers are facing problems in figuring out the perfect job according to their skillset. 

There is no central platform which can help them to derive some conclusive core skills for the specific role which they should be focusing on which will help them fetch their dream job. Also the job descriptions would be varying in terms of skills for the same role for different regions. People might be in a state where they are confused after seeing many skills for the same job profile in different regions. These may also include the upcoming new technologies too. 

Solution:

We can gather valuable insights from the job descriptions in the form of keywords that are in demand and would assist people who are looking for jobs to get insight on the particular skill they might require to crack their dream job. 

This insight would be taken by considering a significant number of job descriptions and calculating the most frequently mentioned and in-demand skill according to the userâ€™s domain like engineering, finance, marketing and many more

These insights will be shown to the user in a catchy and pleasing format using graphs and charts on an analytical dashboard so that the user does not have to go through dozens of job postings to find the ideal skill.
